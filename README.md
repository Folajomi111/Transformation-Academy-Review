Transformation Academy Review + 50% Discount Code
=================================================

You must have heard about the Transformation Academy if you want to be in the coaching field. 

That's why we have gone out of our way to craft this in-depth Transformation Academy review to guide you.

This review will answer your burning questions and expose this platform's courses to you. We will also tell you if this platform is worth your time and money. 

Ready to learn all about the Transformation Academy in this review? Let's get on with it already. 

About Transformation Academy 
-----------------------------

Transformation Academy was founded by a husband-and-wife duo, Joeel, and Natalie Rivera. 

While based in Florida, these co-founders worked hand-in-hand to help people become amazing life coaches.

So far, Joeel and Natalie have tutored over 700,000 students from over 200 countries. They have held the hands of students and guided them to become “INDIEpreneurs.”

“INDIEpreneurs” sounds like a big word. In other words, they are all about helping people be self-employed and get the financial freedom that they seek.

Joeel and Natalie don't believe in a one-size-fits-all learning approach. Instead, they provide their students with tools to build their businesses, land coaching gigs, and live their dreams.

And this husband-and-wife duo makes this possible by offering their courses like a buffet. 

This means that every student gets to pick whatever course they would like to learn. They also have the flexibility of fitting it into their schedule.

Is Transformation Academy Accredited?
-------------------------------------

Well, when it comes to Transformation Academy, things aren't that straightforward. 

So the thing is, Transformation Academy isn't accredited by the International Coaching Federation (ICF). Hold up, they still get the stamp of recognition from the CPD Standards Office. 

Okay, let's explain why that is. The thing with the ICF is that they want Transformation Academy to meet certain “contact hours” to get certified. 

In other words, the ICF needs a certain number of hours from live interactions between a coach and the students. 

But the Transformation Academy doesn't work that way. Instead, this platform is all about flexibility and helping students learn at their own pace virtually. And that's exactly why they don't make the ICF certification cut.

And if you look at it from another angle, Transformation Academy makes things a lot cheaper by choosing virtual learning.

Why I Love Transformation Academy Life Coach Courses
----------------------------------------------------

There are a handful of reasons why I love Transformation Academy and would recommend them to anyone at any time. And they include:

1.  Practical and Engaging Workbook Materials 
    

Transformation Academy stands out by offering practical materials that engage students like the real world. These workbook materials are filled with valuable information and hands-on tools that shape students into great coaches.

In addition, the workbooks are downloadable and can be used as a resource to engage with clients. It also helps make the coaching process interactive and intuitive. 

1.  Strong Toolkit 
    

Aside from providing practical workbooks, Transformation Academy also provides every student with a wide array of tools. This array of tools helps mold every student into an incredible life coach. Also, these tools are crafted beyond the curriculum; they plunge into real-world experiences and give students the firsthand experience they need.

The strong toolkits provided by Transformation Academy include a range of done-for-you materials. 

These already-structured materials were crafted to make things easier, simpler, and less time-consuming for you. Some of the structured materials you'll find in your toolkit include pre-made coaching agreements, questionnaires, and templates. 

All these pre-made documents can be a lifesaver for you. Plus, they eliminate the stress of creating this document from scratch.

1.  Credible Certifications
    

Having a credible certificate from Transformation Academy as a coach paves the way for you in the coaching industry. 

This certificate shows that you are a certified professional in your field. Plus, it promotes trust amongst your clients.

For Transformation Academy, you don't have to enroll in all the courses to earn a certificate. 

Instead, you'll earn a certificate for completing each course. So, if you complete one course, you earn one certificate for the discipline you've focused on. 

And if you've chosen to complete all courses, you'll earn a certificate for all of them.

1.  A supportive Community 
    

The Transformation Academy also offers a supportive community, just like some online tutorial platforms do. 

So after classes, you always have a spot where you can meet like-minded people. In this space, you can always collaborate, ask questions, and share insights with many other people.

The community also offers a space to address problems, share experiences, and learn about helpful solutions in the industry.

1.  Visibility In the Directory Listing
    

For some people, this is the least of the lovable bonuses from Transformation Academy. 

But getting listed in the Transformation Academy's coaching directory still comes in handy in the long run. 

As with some schools, Transformation Academy provides a directory list that spotlights all their students who made it into being coaches.

Being listed in the Transformation Academy directory list can spotlight you as a credible coach. Plus, it can also help boost the trust between you and your clients and expand your clientele. 

Transformation Academy Courses: Master Life Coach Review
--------------------------------------------------------

Transformation Academy offers 4 courses, each with their price. 

As it is always recommended, I wanted to start with the introductory course, Professional Life Coach, which costs $197. But it would have been a waste of money to buy individual courses.

Then I decided to get the ultimate bundle, Master Life Coach, which consists of all four courses. I used a special link and the discount code **SULAIMANBALLO** to get 50% off the Master Life Coach bundle.

Using the special link and the discount code SULAIMANBALLO helped me spend less. So, instead of spending $788, I spent only $249 on all four courses.
